# README for junk branch

This is a branch that doesn't contain any of the actual code from [the master branch](https://github.com/paulkaefer/sandbox/tree/master).

Rather, this is a place to store code that I don't want to delete or store elsewhere,
but isn't worth pushing to the master branch.

This kind of branch can be called **investigations** or **ad-hoc** or something similar,
as it may be used to store code that was used for a special, *ad hoc* purpose, but [we](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we)
may eventually want to revisit.
